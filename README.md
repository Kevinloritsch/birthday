# Hello There!

This is a birthday application, which is the final product of a Ruby on Rails curriculum, designed by me.

The course can be found on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/@rubytutorial2807 .


To use the code in this repo, run "bundle install" and "rails db:migrate" before opening a server.
