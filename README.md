# Hello There!

This is a birthday application, which is the final product of a Ruby on Rails curriculum, designed by me.

The course can be found on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/@rubytutorial2807 .


To use the code in this repo, run "bundle install", "rails db:migrate", and "rails db:seed" before opening a server.


If you have an issue with Webpacker, try running "bundle exec rails webpacker:install".
